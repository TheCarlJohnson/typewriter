Law teaches structure. Procedure teaches restraint. But most real understanding happens quietly — in the margins, between conclusions, after judgments are written.

Almost a Footnote exists for those moments.

I write here to explore law in conversation with technology, policy, and everyday experience. Some pieces are analytical. Others are reflective. Many sit somewhere in between.

The name comes from the idea that footnotes often carry substance without demanding attention. They explain, clarify, and occasionally challenge the main text. My writing aims to do something similar.

This is not a legal newsletter. It is a working notebook — a place to draft thoughts, question assumptions, and slowly refine ideas.

Law school teaches us how to argue. It rarely teaches us how to sit with uncertainty. Yet it is often in that uncertainty that better questions emerge.

Here, I want to write about arbitration and procedure, about systems and small observations, about how law intersects with technology and ordinary life. I want to document thoughts before they become conclusions.

Almost a Footnote is not about arriving at answers quickly. It is about slowing down enough to notice what usually gets overlooked.

If you’re here, you’re welcome to read quietly.
