<BaseLayout title="About">

  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    I am a law student and writer interested in how legal systems, technology, and
    everyday structures quietly shape the way we think and live.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Almost a Footnote</em> began as a place to think in public — to write internal
    monologues backed by legal reasoning, and occasionally by science. The focus is not
    on loud conclusions, but on careful observations, unfinished arguments, and ideas
    that usually remain in the margins.
  </p>

  <p>
    My academic work has largely centred on arbitration, dispute resolution, and
    procedural law, while my writing here explores law in conversation with technology,
    policy, and personal experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Outside writing and research, I enjoy long walks, reading essays, and refining ideas
    until they become precise enough to stand on their own.
