  bio: |
    Law student. Writer. Curious observer.

    I explore law, technology, and the quiet details of everyday life — mixing internal monologue with legal facts and the occasional touch of science. This space is where structured research meets personal reflection.

    When not writing, I’m usually walking, reading essays, or refining thoughts into something worth publishing.
